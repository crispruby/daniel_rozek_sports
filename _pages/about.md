## Welcome
Hi, I’m Daniel Rozek, a Special Olympics athlete, game developer, and lifelong learner living in Kelowna, BC. I was born in Calgary in 1996 to Czech parents, and grew up in Cochrane before settling in Kelowna as a young teenager. I’m now part of the Special Olympics community, and part of the Pulse run club.

## My Journey
From a young age, I’ve been drawn to movement, creativity, and challenge. I grew up playing soccer and cycling, and later dedicated over a decade to Tae-Kwon-Do, earning my second degree black belt and teaching for seven years. The core values of Tae-Kwon-Do:**Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-Control, and Indomitable Spirit** continue to shape how I live and train.
I also live with epilepsy and autism. Diagnosed with epilepsy as a baby, it reawakened at age seven and has presented ongoing medical challenges. One limitation is that I can’t drive, but I’ve adapted by cycling everywhere including sports, appointments, errands, and for fun. Staying active helps me manage my health and maintain a fit body, and my health issue.

## Athletics & Special Olympics
I joined Special Olympics at age 27 and now compete in **Track and Field** and **Cross-Country Skiing**. I also enjoy soccer, basketball, hiking, longboarding, and swimming. For me, sport is more than competition, it’s fun, memorable, and a way to excite my family and inspire others. I train not just to win, but to grow—and to share the joy of movement with others.

## Tech & Creativity
I hold a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems and specialize in **game development, 3D modeling, and database management**. I think in pictures, which fuels my creativity in designing 3D environments and printable models.
I’ve created over **8 free video games online**, and I’m currently working on a new project I hope to monetize. My interests span from Unity game design to inventory systems and interactive storytelling.

## Goals & Aspirations
I’m training for upcoming national competitions and continuing to build my portfolio as a developer. I hope to inspire others living with epilepsy and autism, and to show that with perseverance, effort, motivation and passion, anything is possible.
Whether through sport or software, I aim to create things that make people smile—and maybe even make their day.
