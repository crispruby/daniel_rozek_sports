  <p>
    At the 2025 Special Olympics Provincial Championships held in Prince George, I competed across multiple events in both track and field. In the 800m run, I earned a Gold medal with a time of 2:49.24, showing strong pace. In the 3km and 400m runs, I achieved Silver medals, clocking in at 12:13.24 and 1:05.53 respectively, both reflective of endurance and consistent training. I added a Bronze medal in Shot Put, throwing a solid 9.24m, and placed 5th in the Long Jump with a distance of 3.23m. These results were earned through dedicated work with the NRG Run Club and the support of the Special Olympics community. Every medal represents not just a finish line crossed, but a commitment to thriving through sport, pushing boundaries, and celebrating personal progress.
