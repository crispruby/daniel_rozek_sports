      At the <strong>2025 Special Olympics Provincial Championships</strong> in <strong>Prince George</strong>, I competed in both track and field events with pride and determination. I earned a <strong>Gold medal</strong> in the 800m run (2:49.24), <strong>Silver medals</strong> in the 3km (12:13.24) and 400m (1:05.53) runs, and a <strong>Bronze medal</strong> in Shot Put with a throw of 9.24m. I also placed 5th in Long Jump with a distance of 3.23m. These results reflect months of disciplined training with the NRG Run Club and Special Olympics community—each medal a moment of joy, each finish line a reminder of what’s possible through perseverance.
