    Special Olympics BC Summer Games Provincial Competition of 2025

  <p>
    At the 2025 Special Olympics Provincial Championships held in Prince George, I competed across multiple events in both track and field. In the 800m run, I earned a Gold medal with a time of 2:49.24, showing strong pace. In the 3km and 400m runs, I achieved Silver medals, clocking in at 12:13.24 and 1:05.53 respectively, both reflective of endurance and consistent training. I added a Bronze medal in Shot Put, throwing a solid 9.24m, and placed 5th in the Long Jump with a distance of 3.23m. These results were earned through dedicated work with the NRG Run Club and the support of the Special Olympics community. Every medal represents not just a finish line crossed, but a commitment to thriving through sport, pushing boundaries, and celebrating personal progress. This was my second year of Special Olympics.

    Tae-Kwon-Do Training & Teaching - 15 Years of Discipline & Dedication

    For over <strong>15 years</strong>, Taekwondo was a central part of my life. I trained at <strong>three academies</strong> and competed in multiple tournaments throughout British Columbia, developing both physical skill and inner discipline. For last <strong>7 of those years</strong>, I also taught Taekwondo to students of all ages, from young beginners learning their first stances to adults seeking strength and confidence. My <strong>two younger brothers</strong> and I all earned our black belts together, pushing one another as siblings and athletes. Although we all stopped our training due to the long <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, our journey through martial arts continues to inspire us.
